# Generative Adversarial Network in YUV Color Space for Thin Cloud Removal
This repository is an implementation of "Generative Adversarial Learning in YUV Color Space for Thin Cloud Removal on Satellite Imagery", in Remote Sensing 2021.
# Requirements
· Python3 (tested with 3.6) 

· Tensorflow (tested with 1.9)

· cuda (tested with 9.0)

· cudnn (tested with 7.5)

· OpenCV

· tflearn

· matplotlib

# Preparing the data
The complete RICE_DATASET for Cloud Removal can be downloaded from:https://github.com/BUPTLdy/RICE_DATASET

Sentinel-2A images can be downloaded on the SENTINEL Hub website：https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-playground/

An open-source noise generation tool FastNoise Lite (https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite) is uesd for the simulation of cloud layers.
